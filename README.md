# Advent of Code

Solutions to Advent of Code problems written in Rust. Each problem is in it's own folder as a cargo package with a binary target.

## Run

You'll need to have [Rust set up on you machine](https://rustup.rs/). The simplest way to execute a problem solution is to run `cargo run` in a solution folder.

```sh-session
$ cd 2020/day1
$ cargo run
```

For some problems you may need to build/run the release binary for the program to complete in reasonable time.

```sh-session
$ cargo run --release
```
